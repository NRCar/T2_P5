# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Intro

This repository contains my solution to the MPC Project. The goal of this project is to navigate a track in the simulator with a 100ms actuator latency.

### The Model

The kinematic model includes the vehicle's x and y coordinates, orientation angle (psi), and velocity, as well as the cross-track error and psi error (epsi). Actuator outputs are acceleration and delta (steering angle). The model combines the state and actuations from the previous timestep to calculate the state for the current timestep based on the equations below:

```
x[t] = x[t-1] + v[t-1] * cos(psi[t-1]) * dt
y[t] = y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(psi[t-1]) * dt
psi[t] = psi[t-1] + v[t-1] / Lf * delta[t-1] * dt
v[t] = v[t-1] + a[t-1] * dt
cte[t] = f(x[t-1]) - y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(epsi[t-1]) * dt
epsi[t] = psi[t] - psides[t-1] + v[t-1] * delta[t-1] / Lf * dt
```

The Actuators are: { both have values between -1 and +1 }
- `a` : Car's acceleration.
- `delta` : Steering angle.

The values together form the current state of the system.

The cost was computed using the equations and weights (./src/MPC.cpp#L64).
The main factor that helped was to penalize turns with high speed and accelation during turns. Without this penalty the car usually flew out at high speed. This ensured that the car would accelate and decelarate properly depending on the curve of the road.

The weights were tuned manually until the car was able to drive properly on the road.

### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

The number of points(`N`) and the time interval(`dt`) define the prediction steps. The number of points impacts the delay in predition. The values that were suggested in the project walkthrough i.e using 10 and 0.1 seem to work really well without taking too long or giving bad results. Adjusting either N or dt (even by small amounts) often produced erratic behavior. Other values tried include 20 / 0.05, 8 / 0.125. The actual delay is 100ms so prediction in steps less than that value do not really help.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

The waypoints provided by the simulator are transformed to the car coordinate system at (./src/main.cpp#L119). Then a 3rd-degree polynomial is fitted to the transformed waypoints. These polynomial coefficients are used to calculate the `cte` and `epsi` and create a reference trajectory.

### Model Predictive Control with Latency

To handle actuator latency, the solve function was modified to take addtional state information and the actuator delay. This delay and addtional state was used to compute a new start state based on that delay. (./src/MPC.cpp#L159). This new state was the one that was fed to the solver.

* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
